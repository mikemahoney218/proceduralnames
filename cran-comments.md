## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Fixed a URL by adding a trailing slash, and added this URL to the DESCRIPTION.
* Added a URL pointing to the Docker methods for generating procedural names. 
  No other references are relevant to the methods implemented in this package.
* Fixed two errors in the original README.
